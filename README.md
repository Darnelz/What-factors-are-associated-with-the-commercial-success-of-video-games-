# What factors are associated with the commercial success of video games 

## Project Overview
The project is focused on creating and analysing a dataset of games which was published from August 2025 - August 2026; Specifically on what factors drove the success of video games, I will compare and evaluate and finally conclude what drives success due to the findings I have encountered within the past year.

### The workflow will be the following:

RAWG API
     → 
🐍 Python
     → 
CSV
     → 
📊 Excel
     → 
🗄️ SQL
     → 
🐍 Python analysis
     → 
📈 Tableau


## 01 - How the Data was Gathered
The aim is to gather as much data as I can in terms of games as it would be more time consuming if I handpicked each 90+ games

I started first by scraping information from RAWG which I then (in python) dug through the ‘results’ which showcased  the playtime, name, rating, id, owned, beaten and more but the main aim is to grasp information I can compare which in the end I found was the rating, platform and genre.

I wanted the information I found to be transferred into excel so I can add more data efficiently so I I used my for loop, printing the following games as a list so I can separate it as commas in excel

as it only extracted 41 games I had to manually research for the rest of the games. 
The sources I looked for games will be at the bottom of this page


## 02 - Cleaning the Data
### Old Data

### New Data

I added Copies sold, Revenue and release date in the new data for more comparinsons and insights within my table. What I noticed was that within Column 3/ Genres, they were way to broad so I would normally go into either [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/) to look at the genres and [Metacritic](https://www.metacritic.com/) for the ratings and Platforms for the other remaining games which I manually inputted. the games platforms in the old data was very stiff and broad such as indie when the game genre was more of a Rhythm game such as  Rhythm Doctor

## 03 - SQL Analysis
The Goal here is to Answer the question in form of SQL, underneath is the following which helped me calculate  how I figured out the question (bru idk)

### Q1: How does commercial performance differ between Indie, AA and AAA games? 

 
My hope is to 
Compare Indie, AA and AA by its copies sold, revenue and rating and see what drove

### Q2: Which genres sell the most copies?  
The aim was to compare the total sales or average/median sales for each genre.

### Q3: Does a game's rating relate to its commercial performance? 
Rating → Copies Sold + Revenue

### Q4: Does game price affect how many copies are sold? 
Querying whether there is a relationship between game price and copies sold?

### Q5: Does a game's release period relate to its commercial performance? 

Querying if any months influence growth in games and what month is the most selling (is there any trends?)
